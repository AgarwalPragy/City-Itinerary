Opened in 1999, the landmark boasts plenty of superlatives, including its five-star status.\nBesides shelling out to stay the night at the Burj Al-Arab, visitors have plenty of other options for viewing and touring the sumptuous landmark, which can be spotted from numerous spots around Dubai. Snap a shot of the soaring Jumeirah Beach hotel jutting out to sea on a city sightseeing tour or on a boat cruise.\nTo get inside, choose from the hotel's many bars and restaurants available for reservation. The Sahn Eddar Lobby Lounge offers a decadent seven-course afternoon tea service, set to the sounds of live classical music with views of the hotel's amazing atrium, while the 27th-floor Skyview Bar and its floor-to-ceiling glass windows mix cocktails with stellar views over the Dubai skyline and Persian Gulf. Hungry visitors can book a traditional Arabic lunch inside the world's tallest atrium at Al Iwan, or go for a more international menu with views over the city at the 27th-floor Al Muntaha. For a romantic dining experience, book a three-course seafood dinner at Al Mahara, a restaurant with its own floor-to-ceiling aquarium. Tours of Dubai city often include a stop for photos at the Burj Al-Arab, or you can book a tour that includes afternoon tea or lunch at one of the restaurants. For a different take on the views of the UAE city, book a helicopter tour.\nOne of the most popular Dubai attractions, the Burj Al-Arab hotel stands on its own island promontory, linked to the mainland by a private bridge\u2014you can't miss it. It can be reached by taxi or Red Line metro via Jumeirah Road.\nEntering the Burj Al-Arab requires reservations, and grabbing cocktails at the Skyview Bar proves the most budget-friendly way to get inside (must be booked in advance).\nAlthough the Burj Al-Arab is known for its height, it technically only has 28 inhabited stories. If it's views you're after, only a visit to the world's tallest building, the nearby Burj Khalifa, will suffice.\n ",

        "description": " \nA floral wonderland of 50 million flowers, the Dubai Miracle Garden is one of the UAE's most original attractions. Branded as the world's largest natural flower garden, it boasts hundreds of flower-formed displays spread over 18 acres (7.3 hectares), all of which create an extravaganza of color and scent on the outskirts of Dubai.\nVisitors can book a tour to the gardens with round-trip transportation from Dubai. Many tours also include visits to the nearby Butterfly Garden and Dubai Global Village.\nThe Miracle Garden offers a multitude of floral sculptures, all created or revamped annually and open for viewing between November and May each year. The flower-formed sculptures are created from different species such as petunias, viola, geraniums, and marigolds, and shaped into everything from cartoon characters to castles, pyramids, hearts, birds, and animals. Explore the walkways around the fairy tale-like displays, whose colors and scents are lent extra intensity by the surrounding desert-and-highway landscapes and backdrop of Dubai\u2019s skyscrapers.\u00a0\nThe Dubai Miracle Garden lies in Al Barsha South 3 in the Dubailand area southeast of central Dubai. Drive south via Highway E44 before turning onto the E311 toward the Arabian Ranches. It\u2019s possible to arrive by cab or the buses that run here from the Mall of Emirates metro station, as well as on a guided tour.\nThe garden is open mid-November to mid-May, although dates can vary. Opening hours are generally 9am to 9pm Sunday to Wednesday and 9am to 11pm Friday and Saturday. Remember, the park is closed during the summer months.\nThere\u2019s plenty for youngsters at the Miracle Garden, with sculptures replicating cartoon characters, animals, and other designs. Creations include a 59-foot (18-meter) Mickey Mouse; teddy bears, frogs, and parrots; and even a life-sized floral model of an Emirates Airbus 380 airplane.\n ",

The Marine Mammal Specialists at Dolphin Bay offer five different interactive options, each catered to different ages and swimming abilities. Each experience includes entrance into the resort\u2019s Aquaventure Waterpark as well.\nAt the most basic level, guests can have their photo taken petting or kissing a dolphin without entering the water. The Atlantis Dolphin Encounter, a shallow water interaction, takes guests into a waist-deep interaction lagoon to get up close to one of the dolphins while learning more about their playful behaviors. Capable swimmer can swim with dolphins in a deep water lagoon, and certified scuba divers have the chance to interact with the animals under the surface. ",

        "description": " One of the oldest, largest and most revered temple complexes in Bangkok, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho) is a must-see for all visitors to the Thai capital. The central attraction of the temple complex is its namesake statue, the gold-leaf-covered reclining Buddha, but don't let it distract you from the site's other treasures, including its 95 pagodas, carved narrative panels, and opulent main altar.\nThe gigantic golden Buddha statue is the largest in Thailand, measuring 151 feet (46 meters) long and 50 feet (15 meters) tall. The Buddha's feet alone are 16 feet (five meters) tall, both exquisitely decorated and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. A walk along the length of the entire statue is a treat in and of itself, but visitors would be remiss if they didn't enter the temple and explore the whole Wat Pho compound, which is full of artwork and Buddha images. The oldest temple in Thailand, the complex also remains a hub of knowledge for traditional Thai medicine and Thai massage, and travelers can even book a massage appointment here.\nA key Bangkok attraction, the temple is included in most city and temple tours of the capital, frequently grouped with visits to Bangkok temples such as Wat Arun, Wat Traimit (home to a solid gold Buddha statue), the Gem Gallery, and Chinatown, among other combinations for half-day tours. For a memorable way to visit this and other important sights in the city, join a tour guide for a sunset or night bike tour; hop on a tuk tuk for a fun-filled sightseeing adventure; or board a longtail boat to arrive via the Chao Phraya River.\nThe sprawling grounds of Wat Pho have two walled compounds divided by Soi Chetuphon. The reclining Buddha and famous Thai massage school can be found on the northern side, while the temple's monastic facilities are located in the southern compound. The easiest way to access the temple is by boat: take the Chao Phraya River Express to the Tha Thien pier. The temple is located next to the Grand Palace and behind the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew).\nVisit during the morning or evening to beat the heat and crowds of the middle of the day.\n ",

Today, Thompson\u2019s former residence in Bangkok serves as a museum dedicated to the artist, featuring his personal collection of Southeast Asian art and a display of his various personal effects.\nMade up of six teak wood houses imported from different parts of Thailand, the Jim Thompson House incorporates traditional Thai architecture with a few Western twists, all located within a lush garden on the bank of the Saen Saeb canal. In addition to wandering the various rooms, including the library, painting pavilion, drawing room and the gold pavilion, visitors can also view silk-making demonstrations or stop into the on-site Thai restaurant and the museum shop, which sells quality silk products to take home as souvenirs.\nTravelers can choose to fully experience the museum on a half-day tour that includes admission and roundtrip transportation in Bangkok, or opt for a tour that takes in the Jim Thompson House plus some of the city\u2019s other major sights via various means of transport, including tuk tuk, khlong boat and the Skytrain.\n ",
        "notes": " The Jim Thompson House can be reached via subway by alighting at the National Stadium station and using exit 1, or by taking a khlong boat to Hua Chang Pier. Entrance costs 150 Baht for adults and 100 Baht for visitors under 22 years old. The site is open daily from 9am to 6pm.",

The 37 all-metal spires symbolize the 37 virtues that lead to enlightenment, and when illuminated at night, they resemble candles adorning a multi-tiered cake.\nWat Ratchanatdaram Woravihara was built in 1846 by order of Rama III, its architecture inspired by two similar temples in India and Sri Lanka. Bangkok\u2019s version is the only one of the three remaining. Since 2005 the temple has been under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage status.\nOutside the temple, a market teems with vendors selling amulets to protect against harm or to offer good fortune in love.\n ",

It\u2019s located near the mouth of the Bangkok Yai Canal, although any time spent on this part of the river means you\u2019re unlikely to miss it; the temple\u2019s giant ochre-roofed viharn tends to stand out and demand attention.\nWhile Kalayanamit\u2019s viharn can be said to be traditionally Thai in architectural style, the temple\u2019s other buildings and pavilions have a distinct Chinese influence. This is because Wat Kalayanamit was built in the first half of the 19th century when China was seen as the ideal counterbalance to the growing European influences in southeast Asia. As such, Chinese architecture, sculptures, and other decorative artefacts became increasingly popular.\nInside the huge viharn, an equally huge Buddha statue almost fills the entire prayer hall, while the walls are painted with scenes from the time of the temple's construction. Located next to the viharn, a bell tower houses the largest bronze bell in Thailand.\n ",
        "notes": " Due to Wat Kalayanamit\u2019s location, the best way to reach the temple is by boat. The Chaophraya River Express goes to Ratchinee, where a cross-river ferry makes the trip to the pier located next to the temple entrance. ",

        "description": " \nLondon's Brick Lane Music Hall has a wide range of showings, from traditional music hall performances to original productions. Shows are accompanied by food in the form of luncheon shows, matinees with afternoon tea, and evening shows with a three-course dinner. It is one of the few places in the UK where you can still experience the song-and-supper entertainment that was popular in the mid-1900s. Its name comes from its original location on Brick Lane, but in 2003 the music hall moved to St Mark's Church in Silvertown in East London.\u00a0\nThe music hall was voted Britain's Friendliest Venue by UK travel companies because of its community involvement. The venue provides musical programs and education to local children and puts on performances at care centers for the sick and elderly. The music hall can accept groups and is available for private events.\n ",
        "notes": " Brick Lane Music Hall is located at 443 North Woolwich Road near the London City Airport.\u00a0 ",

The gallery did not spring from a royal collection, \n \n as is the case with many European national galleries, but rather began when the British government purchased works from private collectors to display for public consumption. The museum is widely recognized as having one of the most comprehensive and outstanding collections of Western painting in the world. It is difficult to pick out highlights from such an impressive catalogue, but readers of this description may recognize Jan van Eyck\u2019s The Arnolfini Marriage, Hans Holbein the Younger\u2019s The Ambassadors, and Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers.\n\n  ",

The modern era is well represented too, including royals like Diana Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Cambridge, actors like Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren, and instantly recognizable faces like The Beatles, Richard Branson and J.K.Rowling.\nOpening its doors in 1856, the National Portrait Gallery was the first of its kind in the world and it\u2019s now home to the world\u2019s biggest portrait collection, featuring over 11,000 works. Notable highlights include the 'Chandos' portrait, alleged to portray William Shakespeare; a sketch of novelist Jane Austen by her sister and the much talked about \u2018Ditchley\u2019 portrait of Queen Elizabeth I. In the modern gallery, must-sees include Julian Opie\u2019s celebrated Blur portraits, Sam Taylor-Wood\u2019s video portrait of David Beckham and Marlene Dumas\u2019s painting of Amy Winehouse, while the most bizarre is Mark Quinn\u2019s \u2018Self\u2019, a frozen sculpture of his head made with his own blood.\n ",

For many visitors, the highlight is the climb down the 455-step helter-skelter-style walkway \u2013 a thrilling way to descend from the top of the U.K.\u2019s highest work of art.\n ",

        "description": "\n    \nKnown as both the London Eye and the Millennium Wheel, this huge 450-foot ferris wheel on the South Bank gives a fabulous bird's eye view of London, if your stomach is strong enough. Its inception in \n \n the beginning of 2000 honoured the Millenium; and the spectacular views stretch for 25 miles on a clear day to include views of Windsor and Tunbridge Wells. Up to 25 people can fit in each of the wheel's \"capsules.\" The wheel turns surprisingly slowly-it takes thirty minutes to go round, so there's plenty of time to spot landmarks and take photos. There's a menace looming high above the River Thames, across from Big Ben and the House of Parliament. I kid, I kid. It's just the London Eye, a giant ferris wheel that offers the best views in London. The lines may be long, but the entire ride around the wheel takes about 30 minutes, so you'll get plenty of time to enjoy the view when you finally make it to the front.\n\n  ",
