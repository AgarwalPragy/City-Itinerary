        "description": " \nA floral wonderland of 50 million flowers, the Dubai Miracle Garden is one of the UAE's most original attractions. Branded as the world's largest natural flower garden, it boasts hundreds of flower-formed displays spread over 18 acres (7.3 hectares), all of which create an extravaganza of color and scent on the outskirts of Dubai.\nVisitors can book a tour to the gardens with round-trip transportation from Dubai. Many tours also include visits to the nearby Butterfly Garden and Dubai Global Village.\nThe Miracle Garden offers a multitude of floral sculptures, all created or revamped annually and open for viewing between November and May each year. The flower-formed sculptures are created from different species such as petunias, viola, geraniums, and marigolds, and shaped into everything from cartoon characters to castles, pyramids, hearts, birds, and animals. Explore the walkways around the fairy tale-like displays, whose colors and scents are lent extra intensity by the surrounding desert-and-highway landscapes and backdrop of Dubai\u2019s skyscrapers.\u00a0\nThe Dubai Miracle Garden lies in Al Barsha South 3 in the Dubailand area southeast of central Dubai. Drive south via Highway E44 before turning onto the E311 toward the Arabian Ranches. It\u2019s possible to arrive by cab or the buses that run here from the Mall of Emirates metro station, as well as on a guided tour.\nThe garden is open mid-November to mid-May, although dates can vary. Opening hours are generally 9am to 9pm Sunday to Wednesday and 9am to 11pm Friday and Saturday. Remember, the park is closed during the summer months.\nThere\u2019s plenty for youngsters at the Miracle Garden, with sculptures replicating cartoon characters, animals, and other designs. Creations include a 59-foot (18-meter) Mickey Mouse; teddy bears, frogs, and parrots; and even a life-sized floral model of an Emirates Airbus 380 airplane.\n ",

After that, you\u2019ll be kitted out in your skydiving suit, helmet, and goggles, and then you\u2019re ready to go.\nIt\u2019s time to go inside the 10-meter tall wind tunnel. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re free falling, but actually you\u2019ll be about three meters high (higher after some practice), with vertical columns of air keeping you buoyant. Family and friends will be able to see your progress through the acrylic glass wall, and you can buy films and photos of your trip, too.\u00a0\nIf you choose the basic package, you\u2019ll get two one-minute flights in the state-of-the-art wind tunnel, while the ultimate package gets you two two-minute flights. If you get addicted, you can always add more minutes to your experience.\u00a0\nAt iFly Dubai, it\u2019s also possible to take a skydiving lesson that\u2019ll prepare you for a real skydive. In a one-to-one session, your instructor will teach you all the skills you need to complete a real skydiving free fall course: you\u2019ll learn about turning, vertical moves, altimeter checks, practice pulls, and how to jump from a plane. This package includes five flights of two minutes each, which is the flight equivalent of 10 actual skydives.\u00a0\n ",

        "description": " Fly over Dubai and you'll notice something unusual about the shoreline \u2014 the unique shapes of Palm Islands and the World, some of the world's largest artificial islands. From above, these islands resemble a trio of palm trees (Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, and Palm Deira) and a roughly circular world map, golden on the otherwise azure surface of the Persian Gulf in the United Arab Emirates.\nFirst constructed in 2001, the islands are always in various stages of development, especially the World, which is set to replicate the entire world and cover 5.5 miles (nine km) of reclaimed land. Although the palms are mainly home to a mix of leisure, residential, marina and commercial structures, visitors need not own property (or even stay in one of the hotels) on the completed Palm Jumeirah or any of the other islands to get a good look at this manmade wonder. Tours by speedboat, rigid-inflatable boat (RIB), and jetski take visitors from the Dubai Marina to the Palm Jumeirah archipelago, where it's possible to see the 5-star hotels tower above the water and spot the Burj Al-Arab from afar.\nThe best views of the Palm Islands and the World are from the air. Flightseeing tours aboard a helicopter or seaplane provide the perfect bird's-eye views\u2014and photo ops\u2014of these impressive archipelagos. Heading to the Observation Deck at the Burj Khalifa or to the top of one of the city's many other high-rise skyscrapers is another way to see the sprawling development from above.\nThe completed Palm Jumeirah stretches 3.2 miles (five km) by 3.2 miles. Although there is no public transit in place to reach the Palm Gateway Monorail Station on the coast, from here, travelers can take a 10-minute ride out to the tip of the palm to see the length of the artificial island from a good vantage point. Taxis can also drive out to palm leaves. Dubai's famed Atlantis hotel, Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark, and Lost Chambers Aquarium are set on Palm Jumeirah.\nIf you're in the market for a private island to call home, some of the islands in The World project are still up for grabs.\n ",

Opened in 1999, the landmark boasts plenty of superlatives, including its five-star status.\nBesides shelling out to stay the night at the Burj Al-Arab, visitors have plenty of other options for viewing and touring the sumptuous landmark, which can be spotted from numerous spots around Dubai. Snap a shot of the soaring Jumeirah Beach hotel jutting out to sea on a city sightseeing tour or on a boat cruise.\nTo get inside, choose from the hotel's many bars and restaurants available for reservation. The Sahn Eddar Lobby Lounge offers a decadent seven-course afternoon tea service, set to the sounds of live classical music with views of the hotel's amazing atrium, while the 27th-floor Skyview Bar and its floor-to-ceiling glass windows mix cocktails with stellar views over the Dubai skyline and Persian Gulf. Hungry visitors can book a traditional Arabic lunch inside the world's tallest atrium at Al Iwan, or go for a more international menu with views over the city at the 27th-floor Al Muntaha. For a romantic dining experience, book a three-course seafood dinner at Al Mahara, a restaurant with its own floor-to-ceiling aquarium. Tours of Dubai city often include a stop for photos at the Burj Al-Arab, or you can book a tour that includes afternoon tea or lunch at one of the restaurants. For a different take on the views of the UAE city, book a helicopter tour.\nOne of the most popular Dubai attractions, the Burj Al-Arab hotel stands on its own island promontory, linked to the mainland by a private bridge\u2014you can't miss it. It can be reached by taxi or Red Line metro via Jumeirah Road.\nEntering the Burj Al-Arab requires reservations, and grabbing cocktails at the Skyview Bar proves the most budget-friendly way to get inside (must be booked in advance).\nAlthough the Burj Al-Arab is known for its height, it technically only has 28 inhabited stories. If it's views you're after, only a visit to the world's tallest building, the nearby Burj Khalifa, will suffice.\n ",

For one dirham (about 30 cents), you can go from one side of the creek to the other in a trip that takes only a few minutes. As a significant part of Emirati history, an abra is a simple, medium-sized boat made of wood and powered by a single engine that chugs away at the top of its voice to transport about 20 passengers at a time. Driving styles are unorthodox by western standards. Typically, abra drivers use their feet to guide the sterns. As the authentic way for people to get around Dubai, riding an abra is a must when you tour the city.\n\n  ",

        "description": " \nEvery great city has a river, and Bangkok\u2019s is the Chao Phraya (Mae Nam Chao Phraya). Alive with traditional long-tail boats, passenger ferries, and cargo boats, the Chao Phraya River is the lifeblood of the city. It winds past both ancient temples and modern high-rises, offering a unique, local perspective on the Thai capital.\nTraveling via the Chao Phraya River is a great way to tour Bangkok while escaping thick city traffic. Most of Bangkok\u2019s main attractions\u2014including the Grand Palace, Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun), Temple of the Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho), and Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew)\u2014are easily accessible from various points along the river. Both Chao Phraya Express boats and converted rice barges ferry visitors to popular city sights. Dinner cruise options abound, complete with live bands and traditional Thai meals, while some small-group boat tours explore the more remote \n (canal ways) in Thonburi. In addition to traditional sightseeing tours, visitors can tour the night market and the floating market, or try one of many food-based tour options. All offer unique vantages from which to see the city and help visitors avoid the stress of navigating ferry and boat schedules. You can also stay on land and see the river on a tuk-tuk or bicycle tour.\n\u00a0\nThe Chao Phraya splits Bangkok vertically into two areas and is a popular way to navigate the city. You can get to the river by taking the BTS Skytrain to Central Pier or Sathorn Bridge Pier. River City Pier, located on the eastern side of the river roughly 20 minutes by road or ferry from the Grand Palace, is also a popular jumping-off point for city tours and dinner cruises. To save the hassle of transportation, opt for a dinner cruise with hotel pickup and drop-off.\n\u00a0\nBangkok is most crowded in November and March due to soccer tourism. March, April, and May are the hottest months, while the rainy season lasts from the end of May through October. The Chao Phraya River is a popular thoroughfare morning, noon, and night. For spectacular city views and the best temperatures, consider early morning or evening sunset cruises.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the capital of Thailand moved to Bangkok at the beginning of the Rattanakosin period, European visitors dubbed the new capital \u201cthe Venice of the East\u201d for its many canals. Choose a cruise that navigates some of the city\u2019s more remote \n to see wooden, riverside stilt houses, kids splashing in the river, and some of the city\u2019s colorful and chaotic floating markets.\n ",

Boat services travel through places like Phayathai, Pratunam, Chidlom, and Thonglor, providing a fast and inexpensive way to visit these central areas while avoiding Bangkok\u2019s notorious traffic.\nWhile bordering on dangerously busy during rush hour, taking a Khlong Saen Saep boat outside of these busy times is convenient for shopping and sightseeing, and is especially useful for getting to and from Siam Square and other key places in the city. There are various temples, markets, traditional wooden houses, and ornate bridges along the route, and it is possible to walk or cycle along the banks in many places.\nThe Khlong Saen Saep boats are known for their haphazard service, and are often even dangerous in terms of boarding and alighting in busy periods. In this sense, they are perhaps not suitable for families with small children. If you\u2019re looking to explore the daily life and key sights that teem around Bangkok\u2019s canals in a more relaxed manner, there are plenty of canal tours to choose from; set out on bikes along the banks of the waterways, hop onto a rice barge or small teak boat, or get out of the city altogether on a countryside canal adventure.\n ",
        "notes": " Tickets for the Khlong Saen Saep boats are purchased onboard, and range from 10 to 20 bahts, depending on the distance. (Try to have small change to make life easier for everyone.) There are two lines serving the route: the western line, terminating at Wat Saket near the Khao San Road, and the eastern line, which finishes at Wat Si Bunrueang.",

        "description": " \nArching in front of the sacred Wat Suthat in Bangkok, what is left of the Giant Swing (Sao Ching Cha) is a tall teak structure that once supported a giant seat used during Brahman festivals to honor the god Shiva. The landmark is often spotted on walking and biking tours through Bangkok.\nDuring the festivities, participants would swing in arcs in an effort to reach a bag of gold suspended from a bamboo pole, an act that was believed to encourage a good harvest. A black-and-white photograph illustrating the ceremony can be found at Wat Suthat's ticket counter nearby.\nConstructed toward the end of the 18th century by King Rama I, the swing was later damaged by lightning during the reign of Rama II. In 1920, it was renovated and moved to its current location in front of Wat Suthat. However, there were so many injuries and even accidental deaths that the ceremonies were discontinued for good by the end of the 1930s. In 2007, the Giant Swing was replaced with the current model, while the previous version was moved to the National Museum.\n ",

This large and busy temple shares its grounds with monastic cells, schools, offices, and other buildings, and features a peaceful garden towards the back of its grounds.\nMeditation classes are held here that welcome everyone, with many worshippers and other visitors attending these sessions before visiting the various viharns, shrines, chedis, and Buddha images within the temple\u2019s sprawling complex.\n ",

The modern era is well represented too, including royals like Diana Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Cambridge, actors like Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren, and instantly recognizable faces like The Beatles, Richard Branson and J.K.Rowling.\nOpening its doors in 1856, the National Portrait Gallery was the first of its kind in the world and it\u2019s now home to the world\u2019s biggest portrait collection, featuring over 11,000 works. Notable highlights include the 'Chandos' portrait, alleged to portray William Shakespeare; a sketch of novelist Jane Austen by her sister and the much talked about \u2018Ditchley\u2019 portrait of Queen Elizabeth I. In the modern gallery, must-sees include Julian Opie\u2019s celebrated Blur portraits, Sam Taylor-Wood\u2019s video portrait of David Beckham and Marlene Dumas\u2019s painting of Amy Winehouse, while the most bizarre is Mark Quinn\u2019s \u2018Self\u2019, a frozen sculpture of his head made with his own blood.\n ",

It is named because the road is lined with government buildings and is the center region of the British Government. \n \n In fact, the term \"Whitehall\" is used when making reference to the government and its agencies in England. The Palace of Whitehall, which is the namesake, burned in 1698 but the name remains. This is the place all history buffs visit. This road is a popular tourist spot and is less than a mile in length. The Cenotaph War Memorial marking the \"Glorious Dead\" is a must-see as are structures such as the old War Office that was built in 1906. At less than a mile, tourists can walk the length of the road and visit such places as the popular Trafalgar Square and Trafalgar Studios along with several memorial sites and architectural masterpieces from bygone eras.\n\n  ",
