Given Sites in Problem Statement
	1. TripAdvisor (select data from things to do)
Comments
POIs are stored in multiple pages on site 
POIs are stored in div with class = "listing_title"
for now we have considered starting 3 pages only (can also do upto n-pages
some list in "things to do" contain tours or trips guide provided by some private company => we ignored this 
we have explored all other clubbed urls and extracted attractions from them 
while writing these items in file we added clubbed data in [] brackets also

this site redirects to two sites
